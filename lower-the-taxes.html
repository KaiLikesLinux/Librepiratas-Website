								<h2>Lower and Sane Taxes</h2>
								<span class="byline">Where The Libertarian Party Fails</span>
							</header>
							<p>Idiotically, many people in the Libertarian party, and even most of its supporters prefer outlandish and impossible ideas, rather than plans or facts. Either they think "all taxation" is theft, which it is not. They might also think "capitalism will fuel itself" and "anarchy is the only way." Sadly, the "from each according to their skill, to each according to their need" is a system that will not work. Anarchists and Libertarians have been failing to realize humans are imperfect, and if we did not need government we would not have a government. The world is complicated, and to say removing all laws is the way to go is not just ignorant, it is dangerous.</p>
							<p>Government being a necessary evil, we must label what it can and cannot tax. While most taxation is not needed, there are points of focus we need to worry about. The general rules we need can vary depending who believes how we should spend our tax money. The rules all Librepirata are in belief of: Government Debt should be illegal (and we should pay off what we have), Government should tax "negative influences" like drugs (Cocaine, Weed, Alcohol, Cigarettes, Meth, and others), and all imports should all be taxed as well to promote domestic production. If the government cannot pay for what the budget requires, the budget needs to be fixed.</p>

												Sadly, no government could function well enough to protect the people and their rights without taxes. While we all wish for it not to be the case, we can fix our spending habits. and make our country better. <br>
