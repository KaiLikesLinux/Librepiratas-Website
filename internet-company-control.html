							<p>It is a sad sight to see. Privacy removed from the people to the point it is deemed "fictional," corporations holding small creators hostage, making a false sense of objectivity. The internet today is dominated by a mere couple of corporations. We need to understand that these companies are too powerful, and NEED to be broken up. Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are some of the worst in this business. We need stronger laws against corporations and personal information.</p>
							<p>Firstly, we need to remove private medical records from these companies, and make any form of data tracking illegal. Imagine if you are being followed by a stalker who knows what diseases ale you, following you so people who paid to get your attention are getting it, using information that many would never want another human being to know. That stalker is not one, but four. These corporations should be blocked from knowing every last detail about yourself outside of their own websites. If they advertise to you with the data you give them, that is fine. But it isn't one site, it is hundreds, some of which have to be hosted under their services.</p>
							<p>Secondly, split these corporations up. Google, the subsidiary of Alphabet makes THREE operating systems, several items of hardware, a game studio, a R&D lab, and much much more. Which on it's own this is no issue, but all of these have deep integrations with Google, which collects your data, and already has a near monopoly in two different markets (mobile and search). This gives them incredible power, and they aren't alone. Like it or not, if you use the internet, including this website, you will have touched a server owned by either Alphabet, Microsoft, or Amazon, and have at least one tracker from each. It is becoming more and more rare for these trackers to not be part of a website. This does include services like Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, and many many more. This level of data collection is horrible, and the integrations will only get stronger, making the consumers rights less and less valid.</p>
							<p>Lastly, put a ban on trackers and other internet-spyware tools. While they can use metadata they get on you on websites they own (like watching YouTube content brings you better ads and video recommendations), but no one should have any affect on the user when going from YouTube to The New York Times to Twitter. Keep data collection in check, and things are better for the consumer.</p>
