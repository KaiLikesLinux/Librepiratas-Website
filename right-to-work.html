								<h2>Your Right To work</h2>
								<span class="byline">As long no one is hurt by it, it is legal.</span>
							</header>
							<p>in modern life it is an expectation to get what is known as a "traditional job," which is one usually set in hard labor (or trade) or an office job. People push the idea you must go into the trade workforce or the workforce of an office job that usually requires college. While wanting to work at these jobs is okay, we believe it is the right of the people to work in whatever field is legal at the time. No government should say what work is good or bad, unless it is work that harms another person. Jobs that should be legal are prostitutes, drug distributors (given they apply for a license to sell the narcotics), and any other job that is illegal, but is victimless.</p>
							<p>Other jobs that should be defended are artists, content creators, and the like. These jobs permit people to be creative, in a world where technology is most likely going to dominate most trades. While creative AI might exist, creative jobs will always have a place in society. These people should also be protected, with FAIR copyright law.</p>
							<p>As long it is income that doesn't come from unwarranted harm, like murder or assault, there should be no reason to ban it. Even jobs that promote the harm of the buyer, like bartender, drug dealer, and cigarette seller, as long as the buyer is made aware of the issues and is not lied to about the effects and dangers of drugs like cocain, meth, heroine, alcohol, nicotine, or otherwise. If it is an issue the government wants to discourage, banning is not the correct way to handle it. If an issue like drug use skyrockets, and people are getting hurt, raise taxes on the issue. Discourage people while keeping their rights unhinged.</p>

											<h3>Path to lower taxes</h3>

												Sadly, no government could function well enough to protect the people and their rights without taxes. While we all wish for it not to be the case, we can fix our spending habits. and make our country better. <br>
