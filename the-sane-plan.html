								<h2>The Sane Plan</h2>
								<span class="byline">An Actual Solution To climate Change</span>
							</header>
							<p>For decades we have had the solution to climate change. That solution only gets better by the day. A solution so insanely ideal, that people who oppose it are misleading the public. Nuclear power. While yes, incidents like Three  Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima have all happened, and all are devastating, nuclear power has historically been less deadly than wind and solar power SEPARATELY! Renewable energy is an idiotic and horrible scam that should not be fallen for. Wind and solar especially are devastating to ecosystems and health globally. Here is a fantastic video further explaining this point, and the next paragraph will paraphrase this video. CREDIT: Thoughty2. Thoughty2 is not connected in any way shape or form with Librepirata, we just liked how he explained it.</p>

							<p>PARAPHRASE OF THE ABOVE VIDEO: Global climate change is a severe issue, killing many lives that could have been saved if the temperature is just slightly lower globally. Many countries, especially Germany, focus on energy that is "renewable," and are being praised for such actions. While many believe this is a good thing, this is incorrect. Germany uses mostly wind power. Tons of CO2 is produced in the construction of wind turbines. Wind turbines however dangerous for ecosystems as they are practically bird blenders, and the only sufficient part of wind turbines are the fact they are carbon neutral after 5 months of use. Hundreds of thousands of birds, even rare ones like the bald eagle are killed by wind turbine power. Birds are not the only animals too. Solar on the other hand is horrible because they use incredibly toxic metals. Solar panels that are well made last up to 25 years of use. However, with the popularity of solar energy growing, cheap and not well made solar panels that last only up to 5 years. The disposal of broken solar panels with the toxic metals is not good either. They cannot be recycled easily, or sometimes at all. The toxicity of these chemicals never go away, unlike nuclear waste. If the glass is broken the toxic chemicals can leak all over the place, killing both land, water, and airborne creatures that can make it to the panels in a solar panel farm. Both solar and wind however are ecosystem killers, that only do their primary function when the wind blows or the sun is shining. Some locations only get 10% of the time for either of these things to happen efficiently. 70% of the time, these massive farms do not work, and this is the most efficient farms. When the best of the best farms only function optimally 30% of the time, there is an issue. Even if most farms produce some energy 75% of the time, we need a more bang-for-our-millions option. This inconsistency will leave a need for more efficient sources like fossil or nuclear. Batteries might work in the distant future, but not currently. Thousands of square meters are needed to build these farms, which is devastating to the local ecosystem, no matter where it is placed. Solar and wind have severe damaging effects on the ecosystems we are trying to protect. Renewable energy doesn't even win out-right in safety. While most non-renewable sources are more deadly still, wind and solar are not that safe. Coal, oil, biomass, natural gas, not including the millions killed by pollution, are the most deadly sources of energy, killing thousands. Of the renewable sources are ordered as such (with figures): Hydro (1.4k deaths per Petawatt Hour, also lots of CO2), solar (440 per Petawatt Hour), and Wind (150 per Petawatt Hour, but the data is not complete). At th bottom of the list is nuclear! Of all forms of energy, this one will shock many. Including Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, the death rate per Petawatt Hour is just 90. [The video then explains the pros and cons of nuclear energy].</p>
							<p>Librepirata is built on the idea of innovation, and not harming others. Nuclear waste will rot away, unlike the toxicity of the metals in solar panels and the bird blending of active wind turbines. Hydro produces CO2, which makes it a mute point. We need Thorium-based nuclear energy. Even the Thoughty2 video on this page explains why it is so good. However we see the video by Sam O'Nella Academy explains "Why Thorium Rocks" in this video from 2016. Sam O'Nella is not associated with Librepirata, we just also liked how they explain things.</p>

							<p>Let us focus on Thorium-based nuclear energy. Thorium, being more abundant, safer to work with, more powerful, and cleaner than the coal and Uranium we use today. There are practically no downsides to using Thorium-based nuclear power. The safety of the public AND ecosystem are kept well. We don't need NEARLY as much Thorium than we do Uranium and Coal. All dangers are easily managed. Employees are safer on the job. More power is produced, and is consistent. To fight global warming and climate change, we need to not use toxic and dangerous ecosystem killers, no matter what form they claim to take, and use safe, clean, and powerful nuclear power. Utilizing Thorium to get more power from smaller power plants.</p>
