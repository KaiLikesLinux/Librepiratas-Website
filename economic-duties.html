							<p>We already have a page dedicated to why we want to <a href="lower-the-taxes">lower the taxes</a>, but lowering taxes is not the only thing we need to do.</p>
                            <p>There are classes to society, and we tend to abuse the lower class. Oddly, the rich want to not pay any taxes, even though those taxes will benefit them more. Taxing and abusing the poor and middle class only hurts billionaires, as by a certain point they control all the money, and can't gain or grow anything. An easy way to set fair taxes is by telling people what percent of their income is the minimum.</p>

                                    <td>$95,000 to $149,999</td><td>Yes</td><td>15%</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>Less than $95,000</td><td>Yes</td><td>10%</td>
                                </tr>

                            <p>So, you might immediately notice that only people who earn $150K or more a year have to pay income tax, and even then it doesn't spike until they make $500K or more. The general idea is those in less-than-favorable income situations should be able to keep as much of their own money as they can. The more money people have to spend, the more they will spend. Some may argue that there are more poor people than apply to the forced taxation, that's the point. The rich keep getting richer, and so more government tax dollars should come from them since they have more money. We can use this to fund schools, nuclear power plants, training so coal plant workers don't lose out on their job.</p>
                            <p>Corporations also should pay their fair share of taxes, and it is more deterministic on income divided by a quarter their employee count + 2.5%. So if Billies Pizza gets $500,000 on income, and they have twelve employees, their taxes for that year come to $128125. This leaves more than plenty for $7/hr minimum wage for all twelve employees, as well as general payments like rent, gas, and electricity.</p>
                            <p>Librepirata also sees the pros of universal income, meaning anyone who makes less than $250k a year will also get a government benefit. This gives them more ability to work from home, be entrepreneurs, and boost the overall economy of the country.</p>
